                Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm currently a software engineer at Postman, 
                and previously worked at Slice. I spend my days building features across distributed systems 
                and my languages of choice are Java, JavaScript, and Golang.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love travelling to experience different cultures, 
                and I love trekking as it's a challenge and you meet great people along the way. 
                I have been playing games since the age of Claw, Miniclip and PSP UMD discs, 
                and I've consumed so many anime, manga and light novels I've lost count.. 
                I believe life is all about experiencing new things, 
                trying to be the best version of yourself and sharing your happiness with others.
