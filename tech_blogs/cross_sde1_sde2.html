                    <h4>Step 1: Start Reading Up</h4>

                    <p>Right, so since I've recently hopped jobs I guess I'm qualified to explain this topic. 
                        As a backend engineer at the SDE1 level, you have probably built a few apis/features, 
                        made a few tables and databases, and dealt with infra stuff here and there, 
                        but now you are motivated to take that next step in actually being the person that 
                        has the confidence to fully implement a big feature/product part. No more taking orders from seniors, 
                        you have to be the senior and take part in technical discussions and design meetings, 
                        with devs from cross teams and with PMs, EMs, and you have to finalize the requirements 
                        (albeit iteratively).
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        This is the point where you as a developer have to start reading up on the topics 
                        that you are not aware of. You hear people talk about 2-Phase Commit, and Temporal, and
                        you're left in a daze, your next action item should be to read up on these topics, from 
                        official documentations, or from well known blogs.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I would personally recommend being aware of these following technologies at the very least,
                        Redis (Caching), AWS Elasticache to maintain redis clusters, 
                        <a href="https://docs.temporal.io/develop/java/core-application#develop-workflows" 
                        target="_blank">Temporal Docs for a basic understanding</a>, Postgres, MSSQL, MongoDB, 
                        and a basic find/select query for these languages, Prometheus, Grafana/APM/NewRelic, 
                        Kibana, or Loki, which are commonly used for logging and monitoring, what is Docker (kodekloud is a great resource),
                        <a href="https://kodekloud.com/courses/docker-for-the-absolute-beginner" target="_blank">
                            how would you dockerize a simple project</a>? Difference between pods and containers in kubernetes,
                        difference between K8s and ECS, what are EC2 instances? What is load testing? 
                        (commonly used JMeter, <a href="https://k6.io" target="_blank">k6.io</a>), what is garbage collection? These are a good starting point, 
                        and as you become more inquisitive you will pick up more things easily.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 2: Essential Resources for Interviews and Career Growth</h4>
                    <img src="../assets/cross_sde1/dive-into-money.gif" alt="Step 2" class="article-image">
                    <p>
                        Now let's dive into the essentials (haha, get it?) for SDE2 interviews, 
                        and the resources that helped me massively in my preparation.
                        The topics are - DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms), HLD (System Design) 
                        and LLD (Low Level Design, Coding Design Patterns).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For DSA, I would recommend these resources:
                        <ul>

                                     like stacks, heaps, queues, trees, graphs, linked lists, binary search, quicksort, mergesort, etc.
                                </a>
                            </li>

                        Now let's get into system design, the good stuff (and very essential for gaslighting people /j).

                        And finally, Low-Level Design, where you get to know if you're good enough.
                        What is essential in this section is that you have utmost confidence in your language (Java, Python, C++).
                        Can you make a project from scratch and create a working API endpoint in 5-10 minutes? You are ready.
                        While Java is the cleanest looking (imo) for Object Oriented Programming, and the one I use, if some companies 
                        want you to use working endpoints and integrate with external stuff on the fly, I would suggest Python's FastAPI framework.

                                Small thing to keep in mind, if a service/repository is throwing error, you should throw error in your api endpoint, 500 - Internal Server Error (just an example, could be 400 - Bad Request, or 403 - Forbidden as well upon validation constraint failures), and not return 200 - Success. (Not always but in most cases).

                    <h4>Step 3: Lessons from my experiences</h4>
                    <img src="../assets/cross_sde1/tired_boss.jpg" alt="Step 3" class="article-image">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep talking to the interviewer during DSA and LLD rounds, ask questions if you have doubts, don't keep thinking for yourself, learning to clearly ask your question is a very essential skill. 
                            After your doubts are done, and you have a vague/good idea on how to implement things you should start coding so as not to waste time. Sometimes when a section of your code is 
                            done you will explain that you are going to work on the next section and so on, (doesn't mean you should say okay I have taken input now I will print input, it should be like you have 
                            made BFS function now you will add numbering to the levels to get the earliest point in maze, etc.) </li>
                        <li>Some interviewers will want you to talk with them so they can help, some will be busy with their own stuff/want to see your thinking style 
                            so they will want you to code fast or ask less questions, understand the mood of the interviewer :)</li>
                        <li>During System Design interviews, I would suggest sticking to HelloInterview's approach as it's the best I've seen, 
                            but always check with interviewer after you have designed/written down some major parts, if what you have done is OK and can you proceed or does 
                            he/she want more explanations or does he/she want to discuss more edge cases. For example I was grilled on the 
                            API responses that would be returned even before I could explain the database entities.</li>
                        <li>You are applying for an SDE2 role where there will be lots of talking and discussions, don't be afraid to discuss things during interview :)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        That's all folks! Keep applying, and good luck! (PS: I failed almost 9 interviews before I got my first offer)
